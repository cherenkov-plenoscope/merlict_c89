Merlict simulates light. It finds the intersections of a ray and a complex 3D geometry with special emphasis on surface-normals. Merlict can propagate photons based on geometric optics according to Fresnel. Merlict comes with its own interactive viewer for the terminal. Merlict is a library written in ```c89```.

Merlict reads your scenery from text-files which describe your objects, the geometric relations between them, their materials, and their sourrounding media. Merlict can read a subset of the popular [object-wavefront format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) ```.obj```.
You define photons with a creation-position, direction, and wavelength.
For each photon, merlict gives you the list of physical interactions up to its absorbtion.

# Build :hammer:

## Single Header / Single Source
To involve merlict in your project

```c
#include "merlict_c89/merlict_c89.h"
```

in your headers, and

```c
#include "merlict_c89/merlict_c89.c"
```

in your sources. Thats it. :checkered_flag:
See ```./merlict-c89-test.c``` and run ```./compile_and_test.sh``` for a minimal example.

### Your Buildsystem
Merlict is structured into pairs of ```./merlict_c89/mli*.h```, and ```./merlict_c89/mli*.c``` files which you can put into your buildsystem.

# Viewer :eyes:
Merlict's viewer runs in the terminal and reads three formats:

- merlict's own ```scenery.tar```
- merlict's own ```scenery.bin```
- a standalone object-wavefront ```.obj```

Control your viewing-direction and position via the keyboard. You can inspect the scenery and render high resolution images.
The viewer prints into the terminal using ASCII-art. When your terminal supports [```ANSI-escape-code```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) you can switch to 24-bit true color. The viewer is especially useful when you run merlict on a remote computer via ```ssh``` without an ```X```-server.
Merlict's viewer will try to set your terminal's ```stdin``` to a non canonical mode so that you do not have to press [Enter] after each keypress.

#### Build :hammer:
```bash
gcc ./merlict-c89-view.c -o view -lm
```

#### Run
```bash
./view ./tests/resources/sceneries/001.tar
```

# Interface

## Scenery
css
### Tree
A tree with cartesian frames as nodes and object-references as leafs. The tree defines the relative position and orientation of your object-references.

### Object
A mesh of triangular ```faces``` which are defined by their ```vertices```, and ```vertex-normals```.
To approximate complex surfaces, especially complex surface-normals, you can control the ```vertex-normals``` of each ```face```. The surface-normal in an intersection will be the barycentric interpolation of the ```vertex-normals```.

### Object-Reference
A reference to an object. It bundles the object and the pysical properties of its surfaces and media.

### Materials
You describe a medium by its transmissivity and its refractive index.

You define surfaces by their specular, and diffuse (lambertian) reflections approximating physical surfaces using the Phong-model.

## Photons
Photons are defined by their creation-position, their direction, their wavelength.
During propagation, merlict writes the history of the photon bouncing around in the scenery until it is absorbed.

## Object-Wavefront Format ```.obj```
Merlict supports a subset of the [```obj``` format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) in ASCII-text. An object-wavefront defines a mesh of triangle-faces in a 3D space with special emphasis on the meshe's surface-normal. Each face ```f``` references its three vertices ```v```. The surface-normal of a face ```f``` will be interpolated between the face's three vertex-normals ```vn``` using the barycentrig weight of the intersection-position w.r.t the face.

- ```#``` comment-line. Any text in this line.
- ```v``` vertex-line. Three real numbers define one vertex in the mesh. 
- ```vn``` vertex-normal-line. Three reel numbers define one surface-normal in the mesh.
- ```f``` face-line. Exactly __three__ integer references to vertices define a face. And __three__ integer references to vertex-normals define the surface-normals on this face. References must be positive, backwards referencing with negative integers is not supported.
- ```usemtl``` material-reference. All following faces are assigned the same material. There must be __at least one__ ```usemtl``` before the first face.

Other features of ```obj``` such as e.g. vertex-texture-coordinates ```vt``` will be ignored. Blank lines are accepted but ignored.

A simple cube where each of the six sides references a different material:

```

# Unit-Tests
Merlict has a ```bash``` script
```bash
./compile_and_test.sh
```
to prepare, build, and run the unit-tests. Run this script to check whether merlict builds and runs fine on your platform.
The unit-tests and their resources are located in the ```./tests/``` directory.

The script
- prepares the resources as it ```tar```s the sceneries into tape-archives,
- builds with both ```gcc``` and ```clang```, in both ```c```, and ```c++``` mode,
- and runs the tests.

# Development
Open an issue and describe your problem or wish.

Then its the core developer's job to:
- Write unit-tests.
- Credit and acknowledge original authors.
- Obey ```std=c89``` standard.
- Keep the header's namespace clean. No ```typedef```s! Merlict uses ```mli``` prefix.
- Avoid all Warnings in```gcc``` and ```clang``` in both ```c``` and ```c++``` mode.
- Format ```c``` according to ```./.clang-format```.

But of course the author will happily recive pull-requests that meet such expectations :wink:.

# Suggested Tools
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to inspect and manipulate objects. It is especially useful to visualize surface-normals.

- [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) to create meshes in a parametric way. Unfortunately it does not have a concept of vertex-normals.

- [refractive-index-database](https://refractiveindex.info/) a database of refractive indices of various materials.
