Merlict simulates light. It propagates photons in a scenery, and renders images in an interactive viwer. Further merlict can query intersections of a ray with the scenery independent of light. Merlict is a ```C```-library written in ```c89```.

# Interface
Merlict reads your scenery from a tape-archive ```.tar``` containing human readable text-files which describe your objects, the geometry among them, and their materials. You provide each object with an ID.
Further you provide photons defined by their creation-position, direction, and wavelength.
For each photon, merlict will give you a propagation-history, referencing all objects the photon interacted with before its absorbtion.

## Scenery

### tree
A tree with cartesian frames as nodes and object-references as leafs. The tree defines the relative position and orientation of your object-references.

### object
A mesh of triangular ```faces``` which are defined by their ```vertices```, and ```vertex-normals```.
To approximate complex surfaces, especially complex surface-normals, you can control the ```vertex-normals``` of each ```face```. The surface-normal in an intersection will be the barycentric interpolation of the ```vertex-normals```.

### object-reference
A reference to an object. It bundles the object and the pysical properties of its surfaces and media.

### materials
You describe a medium by its transmissivity and its refractive index.

You define surfaces by their specular, and diffuse (lambertian) reflections approximating physical surfaces using the Phong-model.

## Photons
Photons are defined by their creation-position, their direction, their wavelength.
During propagation, merlict writes the history of the photon bouncing around in the scenery until it is absorbed.

# Build and tests
```
./compile_and_test.sh
```
A script to compile with both ```gcc``` and ```clang```, in both ```c```, and ```c++``` mode. Also run the unit-tests.

# Viewer
A minimal viewer in the terminal.

#### Compile
```
gcc merlict-c89-view.c -o view -lm
```

#### Run
```
./view tests/resources/sceneries/001.tar
```

## Code
- Write unit-tests.
- Obey ```std=c89``` standard.
- No Warnings in```gcc``` and ```clang``` compilers both in ```c``` and ```c++``` mode.
- Format according to ```.clang-format```.

# Suggested tools
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to inspect and manipulate objects. It is especially useful to visualize surface-normals.

- [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/) to create meshes in a parametric way. Unfortunately it does not have a concept of vertex-normals.
