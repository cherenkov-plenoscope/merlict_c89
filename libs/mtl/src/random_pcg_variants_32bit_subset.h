/**
 *  2021 March 23, Sebastian Achim Mueller
 *
 *  Based on 'pcg_variants.h' written by Melissa O'Neill.
 *
 *  I only kept the version with the 64bit sequence state to generate
 *  32bit numbers.
 *  I dropped 'advance', and 'boundedrand'.
 *  I only kept the seeding and the generation.
 *  I split the original header-only into a source.c and a header.h.
